# Welcome to the Winston

I mean you and I both know that this is the readme for my portfolio site. I am a JS dev primrarially so it's shouldn't be too surprising that I used `create-react-app`

<!-- TODO: something about the tech involved and my opinion on the value of these in the current market -->

## TODO:

- finish readme
- find/create/comission favicon
- basic routing (mostly for funsies)
